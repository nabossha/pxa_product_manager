Category Management
====================

Categories are used for both filter view and listing view, but will have different functions, depending on which type of view. In the filter option, it is simply used to filter out products connected to the category, showing the categories in a dropdown menu. For the listing view option, the categories are listed in a left hand menu and also in a grid net showing subcategories.

Adding categories
------------------
The categories are added selecting List in the control panel and entering the folder for product management (or equivalent), and clicking on the plus icon to add new categories. (2.1)

General tab

The tab ‘General’ includes the title of the category (1), which will be shown in the frontend. A parent category needs to be set (2), either the top product category, or a parent category for this category. (2.2)

Category information tab
-------------------------
The next tab is ‘Category information’ where you add the image (1), shown in category grid listing, and also the Description field (2) to add text to a category. Note! These two fields are only used in the listing view option, not for the filter view option. (2.4)

Product attributes tab
------------------------
The ‘Product attributes’ section allows you to select which attribute set that should be available in the products, that are connected to this category. Existing attributes will show in the list on the right hand side (1), and by clicking them, they are moved to the left field (2). The icons in the middle (3) can be used to handle the selected attributes, by marking them and moving them up and down in the list, and removing them from the list with the trash bin. The attributes connected to the attribute set, will show in the product after you have selected a category and saved the product. Attribute sets selected in a category are also inherited to all subcategories, in addition to selected in subcategory. (2.5)
